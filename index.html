            <p>I strongly believe that we can create a poverty-free world, if we want to.... In that kind of world, [the] only place you can see poverty is in the museum. When school children will be on a tour of the poverty museum, they will be horrified to see the misery and indignity of human beings. They will blame their forefathers for tolerating this inhuman condition to continue in a massive way.</p>

        <p class="p1">Bangladesh stands at a historic crossroads, entering an era of profound transformation. After enduring over 15 years of governance plagued by corruption, repression, and exploitation, a student-led revolution has brought about a seismic change. The fall of the autocratic regime has opened the door to a brighter future, now guided by the interim leadership of Dr. Muhammad Yunusâ€”a Nobel laureate, esteemed economist, and symbol of hope. This pivotal moment marks the dawn of "Bangladesh 2.0," a movement that transcends political reform to ignite a revival of our national identity and aspirations. It is not merely a shift in governance but a bold step toward building a just, progressive, and united Bangladesh.</p>
